## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Understanding Gas Mileage

Using the `mtcars` dataset we plot can attempt to understand the relationship
of various factors to gas mileage (`mpg`).

We plot weight (`wt`) vs. mileage (`mpg`) spatially along the x/y axes. We 
visualize the number of cylinders (`cyl`) as colors and the amount of
horsepower (`hp`) as the size of an individual point in the plot.

accidents <- fread("data/Accidents0514.csv", header = TRUE, 
                   
                   sep = ",")
accidents <- accidents %>%
  select(Accident_Severity, Date)

accidents1 <- fread("data/Accidents_2015.csv", header = TRUE, 
                    sep = ",")
accidents1 <- accidents1 %>%
  select(Accident_Severity, Date)

# concatenate data tables and free up environment
accidents <- rbind(accidents, accidents1)
rm(list = c("accidents", "accidents1"))

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "bar", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Mileage Data")
```
